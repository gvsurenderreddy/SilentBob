#   ACKNOWLEDGEMENT    #
########################

This script was originally designed, coded and written by
Jerome Nokin. I hope he will be happy that I have picked up the
pieces of his great work on this firewall script. If a user downloads
the last version ever published, Jay's Firewall v1.0.5, it will find
that it does not work (anymore). I have been able to sort out 
the quirks that kept it from running, and have now published this
altered version as a fork on Github under the name Silentbob.

The goal is to keep the software alive and kicking, and to ultimately
have a nice firewall script to run on gateways and servers.
Although Jerome recommends users to look elsewhere, for instance
at M0n0wall or others, I still prefer Jay's Firewall for
it's useability.

My minor edits and small hacks should not be praised, it was Jerome Nokin
who did the impressive work on this script. Thanks Jerome!

   Description :
	Jay's Iptables Firewall is a bash script that allows one to easily 
	install and configure a firewall on a Linux system. It was initially 
	written for use on a home LAN. The basic features are sharing internet
	over a LAN, forwarding TCP or UDP ports over the LAN log for 
	prohibited accesses and more. 

	The configuration of the firewall is assisted by an interactive 
	configuration tool. You should be able to use the "firewall-config.pl" 
	script for a interactive configuration, or use "firewall-config.pl -g" 
	to generate a empty configuration's file and configure it by hand.

   About the blocking hosts feature ...

SPYWARES
--------

   See README.Spywares



DENYING IP/HOST
---------------

   To deny some hosts from your domain, use the 'block-ip*' files.
   Go on '/var/lib/firewall-jay/',
        edit 'block-ip-in.user'  to deny all access 'from' hosts
        edit 'block-ip-out.user' to deny all access 'to'   hosts
   and configure the firewall for enable the blocking feature (with 'firewall-config.pl' or by hand)


   You may write your own files like "block-ip-{in|out}.<your description>" 
	
	Syntax:  [!]<ip or subnet>:<description>
	-------
           - subnet can be "host.domain.xxx", "1.1.1.1", "1.1.1.0/24", "1.1.1.0/255.255.255.0" 
             or a range like "1.2.3.50-1.2.3.100" but you need to install the iprange module.
           - description : must be less than 24 characters (logs from iptables are limited to 29)
                           no spaces allowed   

	   
        Example:
        --------
           !10.0.0.1:good-guy
           !10.0.0.5:good-guy 
           10.0.0.0/8:bad-guys

           In this example, all subnet '10.0.0.0/8' is denied excepted 10.0.0.1 and 10.0.0.5

           Please put what should not be blocked BERORE what must be it (like in example)

   and configure the firewall for enable the blocking MAC feature (with 'firewall-config.pl' or by hand)



   You may write your own files like "block-mac-in.<your description>"

        Syntax:  <mac address>-<description>
        -------
           - mac address must be like XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
