PICKED UP BY THOMAS FRIVOLD

v1.0.6 01.08.2012
  - Fixed quirks that made the script not work on modern Debian and Ubuntu
    distributions.
    - These quirks were: VERBOSE mode not working properly, so the
    script now acts in verbose mode all the time. I had to rename all ECHO
    lines to echo.
    - Strange behaviors of some parantheses around device names in the
    config files.
    - Some weird uppercase/lowercase typos in the config file
    variables made the script break.
  - Fixed a couple of typos.
  - The script now works on modern systems!

    The 'restart' option restart ONLY the firewall rules.
    The 'flush' options is for flushing all your iptables rules,
    The 'flush-restart' is for restarting the firewall with clean tables 
    (most secure but sometimes #%@&#*.)
