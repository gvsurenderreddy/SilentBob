2.2 Dialog

      Dialog <http://hightek.org/dialog/> is a utility to create nice
      user interfaces to shell scripts, or other scripting languages,
      such as perl. It is non-graphical (it uses curses) so it can be
      run in the console or an xterm.

      Dialog version *0.9a-20020309a* is needed for 'firewall-config.pl'
      if you want to use the interactive configuration mode. See section
      5. Configuration 

3. Install

      Get the latest version in the download section and
      choose the file of your preferred distribution.

3.1. Debian

      # dpkg -i firewall-jay-x.y.z.deb

      or

      Add deb http://firewall-jay.sourceforge.net/debian/ ./
      in /etc/apt/sources.list and run

      # apt-get update
      # apt-get install firewall-jay

3.2. Redhat

      # rpm -Uvh firewall-jay-x.y.z.rpm

3.3. All distributions

      # tar xzf firewall-jay-x.y.z.tar.gz

      # cd firewall-jay-x.y.z

      # make install

      This will copy the files as showed in files section (see website).

4. Upgrade

      First you need to install the firewall as it is explained above.
      This will overwrite your current release.

      The next step is to have an up to date configuration's file.
      */etc/firewall-jay/firewall.config*

      _Upgrade config from version < 0.9.1a_

            Sorry but you can't automaticaly update your current
            configuration's file to the latest version. You need to
            create a new one.
            This will create a new configuration file with the
            interactive Perl script (dialog mode)

            # firewall-config.pl --new

            If you prefere a manual configuration, this will generate a
            empty configuration file that you must edit and configure.

            # firewall-config.pl --generate

      _Upgrade config from version >= 0.9.1a_

            Simply run

            # firewall-config.pl --update

      This will add new variable names and options in your file.

      Restart the firewall with

      # /etc/init.d/fw-jay restart

5. Configure

      There is two mode of configuration. The _Interactive_ mode and the
      _Manual_ mode.
      Both create a comented configuration's file. You may be able to
      start with the interactive mode and continue with the manual mode,
      or the reverse. You can at every moment pass from the one to the
      other.

5.1. The interactive mode

      Run

      # firewall-config.pl --new

      This will launch an interactive configuration's menu and help you
      to create a new configuration's file.
      The [-n|--new] parameter is only for create a non-existing
      configuration's file, for reconfigure the firewall later, only run

      # firewall-config.pl

      You can create a testing configuration's file in an other location
      while adding
      [-c|--config <filename>] parameter.

      For more details see

      # firewall-config.pl --help

5.2. The manual mode

      Run

      # firewall-config.pl --generate

      This will create a empty configuration's file which you must edit
      and configure.
      Here again, you can create a testing configuration's file in an
      other location while adding [-c|--config <filename>] parameter.

5.3. The minimal configuration

      The firewall need some required information before it can start.
      Please verify these few points.

    * _The external interface(s) or Internet interface(s)_
      This is the bad side of the firewall, it can be a LAN if you are
      using this firewall inside a LAN (in this case you need to disable
      the spoofing control).

    * _Your DNS ips_
      Probably given by your ISP, see /etc/resolv.conf (or the config of
      your DNS server if you are using one on the linux box)

    * _If you are running a DHCP server for your LAN_
      Don't forget to enable the "DHCP Server" option in "Configuration
      => LAN" for the interactive mode, or set the variable
      "USE_DHCP_SERVER" to "1" in the configuration's file.
      This mean that your linux box can accept the dhcp requests from
      your LAN. This is a special access because the host may have a ip
      like 0.0.0.0 (only the ips of your subnets are allowed to connect
      from your LANs).

5.4 TCP/UDP Ports for Internet

      You probably want to open some TCP/UDP ports for Internet.
      This firewall support multiple internet and/or LAN interfaces, so
      you need to specify on which interface you want to open the
      tcp/udp ports.

      Here is a example if you want to configure the firewall by hand.

      Syntax:

        TCP_EXT_IN="<iface1>;<port1>,<port2>,<port3>,... <iface2>;<port1>,<port2>"

      Example:

        TCP_EXT_IN="ppp0;22,80 ppp1;25,110"

5.5 TCP/UDP Ports for LAN

      Idem for the LAN. This firewall support multiple internet
      and/or LAN interfaces, so you need to specify on which interface
      you want to open the tcp/udp ports.

      Leave TCP_INT_IN="*" for allow all TCP connections from
      your LAN (idem for UDP), if not :
      Give the list of TCP/UDP ports that you want to allow on your 
      box (and for which interface). '*' mean all ports

      Syntax:

        TCP_INT_IN="<iface1>;<port1>,<port2>,<port3>,... <iface2>;<port1>,<port2>"

      Example:

        TCP_INT_IN="eth1;22,80 eth2;*"

5.4. Firewall inside a LAN

      You can install this firewall inside a LAN, example on a
      single-host or a sub-LAN (here the external interface is a LAN
      interface), but *you need to disable the spoofing control*.

      The spoofing control deny the internet hosts claiming to come from
      a LAN (with a private source ip like 10.0.0.0/8, 192.168.0.0/24,
      ...), but inside a LAN ... you need to use these ips.

      To disable the spoofing control with the firewall-config.pl
      utility, go on *Configuration => Internet* or open the
      configuration's file and set the variable "SPOOFING_CONTROL" to
      *1* in the configuration's file.


6. Start the firewall

      _Warning:_ The firewall needs the ips of your network's cards
      and/or your internet connection.
      The firewall needs to be started after the network and other
      script's connections, if it can't found at least one connected
      external interface (like internet), it will not want to start.

      Play with

        # /etc/init.d/fw-jay {start|stop}
        # /etc/init.d/fw-jay {up|down}
        # /etc/init.d/fw-jay {restart}
        # /etc/init.d/fw-jay {check}
        # /etc/init.d/fw-jay {reload-block-ip|reload-block-mac}

      The up|down options are for compatibility and have the same
      effects as start|stop.
      The check option is for testing the config's file.
      The reload-block-{ip|mac} options are for reloading the block
      ip/mac denying files when the firewall is up.

7. Automatic startup

      The firewall needs the ips of your network's cards and/or your
      internet connection.
      The firewall needs to be started *after* the network and other
      script's connections, if not, it will not want to start.

      Simply add a link in your runlevel, get your default runlevel from
      your /etc/inittab file.

      _Example with rc3.d_

        # ls -l /etc/rc3.d/
        ...
        lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root  S40network  -> ../init.d/network
        lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root  S45adsl     -> ../init.d/adsl
        ...

            The /network/ start in position *40* and the /adsl/ in
            position *45*
            Start the firewall in position *46*

        # cd /etc/rc3.d/

        # ln -s ../init.d/fw-jay S46fw-jay

        # ls -l /etc/rc3.d/
        ...
        lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root  S40network -> ../init.d/network
        lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root  S45adsl	   -> ../init.d/adsl
        lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root  S46fw-jay  -> ../init.d/fw-jay
        ...
